# NEAT_DEMO
In this project, utilizing NEAT Python and the Gymnasium library, I create neural networks that can balance a pole on a moving [cart](url). 
The documentation and guide on develping neural networks through neat is found [here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html)https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html) and the simulation of the pole cart [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)https://gymnasium.farama.org/).
